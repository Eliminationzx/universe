Gavin's notes on getting gitian builds up and running:

You need the right hardware: you need a 64-bit-capable CPU with hardware virtualization support (Intel VT-x or AMD-V). Not all modern CPUs support hardware virtualization.

You probably need to enable hardware virtualization in your machine's BIOS.

You need to be running a recent version of 64-bit-Ubuntu, and you need to install several prerequisites:
  sudo apt-get install git apache2 apt-cacher-ng python-vm-builder ruby docker-ce

Sanity checks:
  sudo service apt-cacher-ng status   # Should return apt-cacher-ng is running

Once you've got the right hardware and software:

    git clone https://github.com/universe-project/universe.git
    git clone git://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder.git
    mkdir gitian-builder/inputs

    # Download all dependencies specified in gitian descriptors (files clause)
    # and place them in gitian-builder/inputs

    cd gitian-builder

    export PATH="$PATH":$PWD/libexec
    export USE_DOCKER=1

    #bin/make-base-vm --arch i386 --docker
    bin/make-base-vm --arch amd64 --docker
    cd ..
