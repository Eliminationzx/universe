### About

Universe is a decentralised digital cryptocurrency that uses proof-of-stake consensus as a security model, with a combined proof-of-stake/proof-of-work minting system.

Universe uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.
